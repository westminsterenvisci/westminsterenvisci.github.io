  <div class="container-fluid"><!--This is the box all of our content will go in, think of laying out your webpage like laying out a grid

  We will use rows and columns like a child graphing things. A row will go all the way across the page, so it has an assigned width of 100%. There are 12 columns used in most websites and in yours. You can assign a column of content to any number of columns. For instance if you want a block of text to take up the left half of the page, put it in a column that is 6 columns wide because that's half of 12. That column would be called "col-xs-6" because bootstrap labels it that way. Red lines will outline our grid for now and I can show you how to remove them so that you can see what your webpage would actually look like-->
