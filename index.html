  <!--We will use rows and columns like a child graphing things. A row will go all the way across the page, so it has an assigned width of 100%. There are 12 columns used in most websites and in yours. You can assign a column of content to any number of columns. For instance if you want a block of text to take up the left half of the page, put it in a column that is 6 columns wide because that's half of 12. That column would be called "col-xs-6" because bootstrap labels it that way. Red lines will outline our grid for now and I can show you how to remove them so that you can see what your webpage would actually look like-->

This could be as large as "Amphibians" or as specific as "New World Monkeys of Central America". You will also note a case study of an iconic species representative of your population, the current threats to each of the 5 species you cover, and suggest some management strategies. Along the way you will hopefully also become more comfortable with design layout of web pages and working with html and css. As an example I have provided the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/westminster.net/file/d/0B8e7Dngz1vUobzk2b1FMR2Fhcjg/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">State of the Birds</a> pdf file as an example of the information you are asked to provide as well as a very simple<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/westminster.net/document/d/1P9Rdf9z9MOR8nTc-h3bWA9lKcTE0HVolqpbuDLv9SMg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> rubric</a>.<br><br>Your files will be linked below. You will decide as a class whether they should be text links or images. To the right, you will find a video outlining your first step. I hope you all enjoy this project and learn a lot of transferable skills along the way! Good luck!<br><br></h2-2></div>
