 <!-- We will use rows and columns like a child graphing things. A row will go all the way across the page, so it has an assigned width of 100%. There are 12 columns used in most websites and in yours. You can assign a column of content to any number of columns. For instance if you want a block of text to take up the left half of the page, put it in a column that is 6 columns wide because that's half of 12. That column would be called "col-xs-6" because bootstrap labels it that way.

      <div class="col-xs-4"><h2 class="brown">Sharks</h2><h2-2 class="navy" style="font-size: 16px;">People are one of the primary threats to sharks as it is estimated that around 70 million sharks are killed every year by humans. 
Killer whales that reside in the waters around New Zealand prefer marine mammals such as sharks. 


It is difficult to estimate population numbers of sharks since there are many different species spanning a large geographic area. However, overall shark numbers are on the decline due to the many threats they face in the wild. However, sharks have adapted to living in a wide range of aquatic habitats at various temperatures. While some species inhabit shallow, coastal regions, others live in deep waters such as on the ocean floor and in the open ocean. Some species, like the bull shark are even known to swim in salt, fresh, and brackish waters.

Most sharks are especially active in the evening and night then they hunt. Some sharks migrate over great distances to feed and breed. This can take them over entire ocean basins. While some shark species are solitary, others display social behavior at various levels. The diet of a shark includes things like fish, crustaceans, mollusks, plankton, krill, marine mammals and other sharks. Sharks also have a very acute sense of smell that allows them to detect blood in the water from miles away. Some shark species, like the great white shark, attack and surpise their prey, while other sharks like the basking shark filter feed by swimming through the ocean with their mouths open wide, filtering large quantities of plankton and krill.

      <div class="col-xs-4"><h2 class="brown">Otters</h2><h2-2 class="navy" style="font-size: 16px;">Otters are considered to be carnivorous mammals. There are 13 different otter species and they are all either semiaquatic, marine, or aquatic otters with their diet consisting of different kinds of meat. Otters depending on what type of otter they are tend to be anywhere from 1.5 to 4 feet long and anywhere from 6 to 30 pounds heavy. The Eurasian otter is usually the heaviest otter and can grow to be the tallest otter. Sea Otters like to eat anything from crabs to clams. Fun Fact: Otters spend the majority of their day licking and grooming themselves. Otters love to play with other Otters, and they like to slide off rocks into the water, and wrestle with other otters in the water. 


Otters are nocturnal and they tend to hunt for their food at night. Otters are found almost all over the world in wet habitats such as rivers, lakes, oceans, and other bodies of water. Otters tend to be lazy when building their habitats, which result in them living in dens made by other animals. The dens can usually be home to Beavers, but the Otters take over many of them, and make many inner chambers throughout their den that they can move around in. Otters rarely ever come on the shore, however they tend to groom themselves and do all of their individual activities while they are in the water.

      <div class="col-xs-4"><h2 class="brown">Penguins</h2><h2-2 class="navy" style="font-size: 16px;">Penguins are aquatic, flightless birds that are highly adapted to life in the water. Their distinct tuxedo-like appearance is called countershading, a form of camouflage that helps keep them safe in the water. Penguins do have wing-bones, though they are flipper-like and extremely suited to swimming. Penguins are found almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, where they catch their food underwater and raise their young on land.
Penguins can be found on every continent in the Southern Hemisphere from the tropical Galapagos Islands (the Galapagos penguin) located near South America to Antarctica (the emperor penguin).
Penguins can spend up to 75% of their lives in the water. They do all of their hunting in the water. Their prey can be found within 60 feet of the surface, so penguins have no need to swim in deep water. They catch prey in their beaks and swallow them whole as they swim. Some species only leave the water for molting and breeding.
In addition to global warming and natural predation by sharks, orcas, leopard seals, sea lions and fur seals, other threats to penguins include impacts on habitat due to oil spills, pesticides, construction, destruction of habitat due to introduced herbivores, competition with humans for food and illegal egg harvesting.

Pollution and chemical contamination make orcas more susceptible to disease and likely cause reproductive difficulties.
Being one of the apex predatators in the ocean food chain, orcas are mainly susceptible to human 
Within their ocean haunting grounds, killer whales typically gravitate to waters with depths of between 65 and 196 feet. When on quests for sustenance, however, it isn't rare for them to venture nearer to the coast in waters that are much shallower. Killer whales also favor cold waters, although they frequently remain in temperate locations, too. Less commonly, they can also be found in both subtropical and tropical environments.
The orca, or "killer," whale is the largest member of the dolphin family. Orcas have long, rounded bodies with large dorsal fins at the middle of their backs.Orcas are highly social animals that travel in groups called pods. Pods usually consist of 5 to 30 whales, although some pods may combine to form a group of 100 or more. Orcas establish social hierarchies, and pods are lead by females.

      <div class="col-xs-4 secondblock"><h2 class="brown">Dolphins</h2><h2-2 class="navy" style="font-size: 16px;">Climate change is causing dolphins to go into colder water to feed on their primary food source, which is causing scientists to worry that the dolphins won’t be able to adapt as quickly as necessary to find new feeding grounds. 
Some types of sharks such as great white sharks eat small species of dolphins. 
Occasionally, killer whales eat small dolphins depending on their habitat. 

Most species live in shallow areas of tropical and temperate oceans throughout the world.

Dolphins are well known for their agility and playful behaviour, making them a favorite of wildlife watchers. Many species will leap out of the water and follow ships, often synchronizing their movements with one another. Scientists believe that dolphins conserve energy by swimming alongside ships, a practice known as bow-riding. 
Usually, they live in social groups of five to several hundred. They use their echolocation to find prey and often hunt together by surrounding a school of fish, trapping them and taking turns swimming through the school and catching fish. Interestingly, they will sometimes follow seabirds, other whales and fishing boats to feed on the fish they spare or discard. A dolphin’s usual diet consists of a variety of prey such as fish, squid and crustaceans. <br><br></h2-2>

		<h2-2 class="navy">We the people can control and help save these animals with very few simple steps. If we the people decide to start buying products that can better of the environment, then it will allow other businesses to help the environment with their resources. We need to take major steps to help protect marine habitats, and make sure we control the pollution as much as we can. We need to create wildlife refugees to conserve and protect the animals and their marine habitats. We need people to be aware of the problems, and we need people to report any illegal activities that could lead to destruction of certain marine habitats. Many species can’t survive outside of there habitat, so we need to help protect these animals by reporting illegal activities, decrease pollution, and creating more human controlled habitats to help these animals that are threatened by habitat destruction.
